## Hello :wave:

### I am a full stack software engineer

I specialise in server-side development. I like cloud native tech and to automate everything possible.

* Full stack software engineer, strong in PHP with Laravel. TDD all the way.
* I'm also very interested in DevOps and automation - self-host a bunch of services.
  * Comfortable with `docker`, `terraform` and `ansible`.
* I am always keen to learn, sometimes I write about my journey in learning new things. You can see recent posts below or everything at my [technical blog](https://ac93.uk).

> A relatively basic Laravel integration with an Amazon Cognito user pool with two clients. The first client for web users will be used to initiate &lpar;from Laravel&rpar; login/logout on Cognito&amp;rsquo;s hosted UI with email/password. The second client will be for system users, which will generate tokens with email/password through API instead of hosted UI.
