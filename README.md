## Hello :wave: 

### I am a full stack software engineer

* Full stack software engineer, strong in PHP with Laravel.
* I'm also very interested in DevOps and automation - self-host a bunch of services.
* I am always keen to learn, sometimes I write about my journey in learning new things. You can see recent posts below or everything at my [technical blog](https://ac93.uk).
