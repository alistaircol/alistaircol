[Basic Cognito user pool with login/logout integration in Laravel, with users/system clients](https://ac93.uk/articles/laravel-integration-with-amazon-cognito/)
> A relatively basic Laravel integration with an Amazon Cognito user pool with two clients. The first client for web users will be used to initiate &lpar;from Laravel&rpar; login/logout on Cognito&amp;rsquo;s hosted UI with email/password. The second client will be for system users, which will generate tokens with email/password through API instead of hosted UI. Finally, a simple console command to decode/verify web and system users&amp;rsquo; JTWs from the user pool&amp;rsquo;s JWKS.
